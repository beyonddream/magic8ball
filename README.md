# magic8ball
Magic 8 Ball answer generator

## Example

```ruby
require 'magic8ball'
magic8ball = Magic8Ball.new
print magic8ball.ask("Will it rain today?")
```
For more info, checkout `magic8ball.rb` or the test file `test_magic8ball.rb`. Really, it is dead simple.

## Why
This is a silly ruby program but I wanted something simple and goofy to try for fun. It is inspired by the perl implementation [here](https://github.com/simonwistow/Acme-Magic8Ball/blob/master/lib/Acme/Magic8Ball.pm)
